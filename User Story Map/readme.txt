**Story Map of Grocery Dlivery App:**

_Thought process:_
    1. to think about the user's wants and needs in order to establish the purposes of the app.
    2. I focused on the things that make the application usabela and functional such that the user can needs, such as having an account, being able to search for items, adding items to cart, viewing prices for items, seeing total, placing an order then getting the groceries delivered to the customer. 
    3. I thought things such as having a live map of the groceries, where they are in this delivery process and whos delivering them is an important feature for the user's expierience about the app and the usage of it. 
    
_Desicions:_
    1. focusing on user's needs rather than wants: that was clear in my map, as i focused on the things that the user would need to accomplish the goal of the app which is to deliver the groceries. For example I focused on the fact that the app needs to display prices of items, easy way for payment options and methods, and lastly to be able to see the actual images of the items themselves so that the customer can pick accordingly. 
    2. try to come up with as much tasks as I can to accomplish the goal of the app then order them in terms of the bigger tasks and then creating a backbone for those tasks. 
    3. to focus on three main things in the backbone: user profile, user expierence and user satsfaction with the execution of the application. this is because these things are what make up the app and allow the user to use properly, with ease and with a purpose. 

_Extra features:_
    1. the few features that I used are: changing the colors of the cards, with tasks in MVP 1 and MVP 2 being green and the backbone being blue and the rest of the unscheduled tasks as white. I also used the priorty feature on some of the tasks and highlight is they need to be done urgently or not.
